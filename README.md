# Heart Disease Risk Prediction with Bayesian Networks

This project uses a Bayesian Network to predict the risk of heart disease based on simulated patient records from `heart_disease.csv`.

## Project Overview

- Clean and normalize patient data
- Build Bayesian Network using `pgmpy`
- Perform probabilistic inference to assess heart disease risk
- Visualize network and inference results

## Setup Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HemanthM8/Heart-Disease-BayesianModel.git
cd Heart-Disease-BayesianModel
```
Run the notebook.
